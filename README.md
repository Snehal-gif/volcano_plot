# heatmap Visualization and DEG 

Heatmap is a graphical way to visualize visitor behavior data in the form of hot and cold spots employing a warm-to-cool color scheme. 
The warm colors indicate sections with the most visitor interaction, red being the area of highest interaction,
and the cool colors point to the sections with the lowest interaction.

DEG:
Differential expression analysis means taking the normalised read count data and performing statistical analysis to discover 
quantitative changes in expression levels between experimental groups.

Interpretation : A volcano plot is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (P value) versus magnitude of change (fold change).
